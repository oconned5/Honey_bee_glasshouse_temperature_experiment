# Honey_bee_glasshouse_temperature_experiment
Data and analyses from a glasshouse experiment investigating the impact of temperature on honey bee physiology

In this experiment honey bees hives were placed in a temperature controlled glasshouse (four replicates with four hives in each replicate) and exposed to a range of temperatures predicted to be experienced in Ireland in the near future, over a six day period Each replicate experienced the temperature range in a different randomised order to separate the impact of time and temperature Honey bee movement in and out of the hive was measured with counters placed over the entrance to each hive which counted the number of bees that entered and left the hive in five minute increments The temperature and humidity of the central brood frame of each hive was measured every 15 minutes by iButtons

In our analyses we used GLMMs to invesitagte the impact of glasshouse temperature on the physiology of the honey bees
